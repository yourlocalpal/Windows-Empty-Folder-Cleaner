# Empty Folder Cleaner

This batch script is designed to delete empty folders within a specified directory. It scans through all subdirectories and removes any folders that do not contain any files or folders.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have [Batch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file) scripting support on your system.
2. Download or clone the repository.
3. Edit the script file `empty-folder-cleaner.bat` to set the `rootDirectory` variable to the target directory where you want to delete empty folders.
4. Run the script by double-clicking on `empty-folder-cleaner.bat`.

## Important Note

**Please use this script with caution**. Deleting folders can have irreversible consequences, and it is recommended to have a backup of your data or test it on a small subset of folders before running it on a large scale.
