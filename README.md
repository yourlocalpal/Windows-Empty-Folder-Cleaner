# Empty Folder Cleaner

This batch script is designed to delete empty folders within the first level subdirectories of a specified directory. It scans through the immediate subdirectories and removes any folders that do not contain any files or folders. After deletion, the console will print how many folders were deleted. You could edit this further to store logs per deletion. Something to keep in mind.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have [Batch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file) scripting support on your system.
2. Download or clone the repository.
3. Edit the script file `empty-folder-cleaner.bat` to set the `rootDirectory` variable to the target directory where you want to delete empty folders.
4. Run the script by double-clicking on `empty-folder-cleaner.bat`.

## Important Note

**Please use this script with caution**. Deleting folders can have irreversible consequences, and it is recommended to have a backup of your data or test it on a small subset of folders before running it on a large scale.
